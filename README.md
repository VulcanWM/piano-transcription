# Piano Transcription 

I am using [`piano_transcription_inference`](https://github.com/bytedance/piano_transcription) to transcribe my mp3 file into piano notes.

I also have a `model.pth` file but it is too large for me to upload on GitHub, but it can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4034264/files/CRNN_note_F1%3D0.9677_pedal_F1%3D0.9186.pth?download=1).
